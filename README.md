# Dynamic Strings Array  
  
  
I needed a way to add or delete a string from an array of strings for an up coming project. You can delete the string from any part of the array. It works great, but has one major flaw, it can only handle 1 array of strings. Eventually, I want to set it up for multiple arrays, but for now this works for my needs.
