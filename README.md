# Dynamic Strings Array  
  
  
I needed a way to add or delete a string from an array of strings for an up coming project. You can delete the string from any part of the array. It works great, but has one major flaw, it can only handle 1 array of strings. Eventually, I want to set it up for multiple arrays, but for now this works for my needs.  
  
~~NOTE : This still causes an access violation after adding 4 strings. I am working on it and will upload the Fix as soon as I am able.~~  
THIS IS NOW FIXED !

NOTE : Sadly I have to post this now on all my projects, since others are trying to mimic my channel. They are using my logo, banner and videos to pretend to be me. So pay close attention to which youtube channel you are on.
