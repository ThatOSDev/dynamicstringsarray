# Dynamic Strings Array  
  
I needed a way to add or delete a string from an array of strings for an up coming project. You can delete the string from any part of the array. It works great, but has one major flaw, it can only handle 1 array of strings. Eventually, I want to set it up for multiple arrays, but for now this works for my needs.  
  
Variadic Functions are now working --> C, S, D, B, X, LLU, LF --> See picture below to see these in action.  

NOTE : Long Floats are only accurate up to 15 Digits of precision. Example : 3.141592653589793 works. However if you change it to something like 53.141592653589793 then the 3 at the end is unstable and could result in a different number based on your Operating System and / or compiler.

NOTE : Sadly I have to post this now on all my projects, since others are trying to mimic my channel. They are using my logo, banner and videos to pretend to be me. So pay close attention to which youtube channel you are on.
